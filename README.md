Throughout my professional journey, I've served as a Java developer, delving into the leading market frameworks such as Apache Camel and SpringBoot. My passion has always been crafting microservices, both synchronous and asynchronous, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, using API RESTful and OpenAPI/Swagger.

My path led me to explore the world of API Gateways, where I used tools like ZUP API Manager and ApiGee to facilitate communication between systems. I also ventured into the cloud, exploring Microsoft Azure, where I learned to make the most of the platform's resources.

To keep projects on track, I became a proponent of Configuration Management and DEVOPs tools like Git, Maven, Jenkins, and Openshift. Working in a team has always been a great passion, and Agile Methodologies were our compass in the journey of agile development.

In my journey, I didn't just write code; I also designed technical solutions and sketched out architectures for complex projects, whether enhancing existing systems or bringing new ideas to life. Leading meetings with colleagues from various areas, such as Architecture, Change Management, and DevOps, is part of my DNA.

Over time, I honed my ability to estimate efforts and create realistic schedules, which contributed to the success of many projects. And when things got tricky, my knowledge of application monitoring and troubleshooting tools like Dynatrace was my magic wand to keep things running smoothly.
